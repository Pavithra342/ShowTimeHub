# ShowTimeHub

The main objective of the Online Movie Ticket Booking System is to manage the details of Movies, Tickets, Bookings, Show Timings, and Customers. It handles all the information about Movies, Auditoriums (Audi), and Customers efficiently. The project is entirely built for administrative use, ensuring that only the administrator has access.

The purpose of the project is to develop an application that reduces manual effort in managing Movies, Tickets, Audis, and Bookings. It tracks all details related to Bookings, Show Timings, and Customers.

Additionally, after booking a ticket, the customer will receive a confirmation email with all the booking details.
